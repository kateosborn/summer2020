Import and create scanner
Import and create random
Prompt user for number of days
    Print "How many day's temperatures?"
define int days as answer
Create user control while loop for when it doesn't satisfy
redefine days as answer
create new array weather to store daily temps
initialize variable sum as 0
initialize variable average as 0
initialize variable counter as 0
Create random randy bounded from 25 to 110 inclusive
Create for loop controlled by days and initialize i as 0
    a = i + 1
    Println: Day a's high temp is: + randy
    sum = sum + randy
    average = sum/a
    if randy > average
        counter = counter+1
Println average temp = average
Println counter days were above averageâ€©
